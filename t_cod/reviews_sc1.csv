Nov 2020,50,Still a Paradise in Santa Cruz,"This is a resort I regularly visit because of their butterfly park and aviary. The gardens are awesome and give you a glimpse of native South American forests, so the vegetation is rather exotic as well. There are plenty of orchids, bromeliad and several sorts of ferns which altogether make up a magic atmosphere.    The park itself has several pools, which comprise a day club with a SPA, a couple of bars and a gourmet restaurant. The food is awesome and unfortunately for me ( who needs to lose some 60 pounds) the portions are also rather generous.    There are also several cabins and a hotel. I stayed on Cabin 02 which is for two persons, and it is near the reception. The decoration is well made and the paintings are all signed by the Author.    The original theme of the park was the human mind, thus there is a very well made museum of natural history, called the ""Evolusseum"" which is equipped with a multimedia and english guiding system.    Users can also play sports ( soccer and volleyball ) or ride a train ( or whatever that vehicle came from or even horses.    The days spent in Guembe were urgently needed after this horrendous year, and I thank with my hearth the staff for always being there for me."
Feb 2020,50,Yearly visit,"Visit Santa Cruz each year for work from Nova Scotia, Canada. Always make a point to visit here. Love getting my yearly selfie with the Toucans!!! Totally recommend visiting Bolivia, never had anything but great experiences, even met the President of Bolivia in Feb 2020 when she walked into the restaurant we were dining in."
Feb 2020,50,Great place to visit with friends and family,"The owner of Güembé developed this land as a sanctuary for butterflies, some typical birds and animals from the amazons.  Our hostess was Ilia, she spoke several languages and labeled herself as an intelectual. Ilia did not disappoint, she knew every aspect of the resort as she was giving us the tour.  You can stay the entire day, walking the grounds , using the many amenities as rowing lift boats. They have many swimming pools. They also serve food in their restaurant.  I would highly recommend that you visit this sanctuary."
Feb 2020,50,Impressed as tourists,"We had a spare day in santa cruz so thought we'd go for a visit here. We were shocked with the entry fee do a bit annoyed to start with. Anyway the plyour face, thought it was well done but were still reeling about the price. We went to the butterfly hous4 first and it was amazing except there weren't any butterflies. Next the aviary. Amazing. So big. Lots of McCaws, a great mirador and a few other birds. Mo toucans as promised. But still pleasant. Then we went fir a walk and saw lots if squirrel monkeys. So adorable.  Then we discovered the pools. This really really impressed us we stayed for ages even though it rained. As we left we thought that it was money well spent. We had a fabulous relaxing day. Congratulations guembe. Your park is superb."
Jan 2020,40,Nature refreshing contact,"Beautiful place, lots of plants and animals, nice swimming pools and lagoons. Birds (toucans, blue and red parabas, ostriches, etc.) are inside an enormous cage, they walk and fly around you. Don't give them your finger!!! There is also a cage with only butterflies. Tickets for adults cost less than $US20. It takes 30 minutes and there is a bus that depart every hour from Ventura mall and the last one return a 5pm. Bus ticket $US2. Don't miss it!! It has a hotel, restaurant and small snacks."
Sep 2019,40,"Nice walk, interesting animals, great place for a swim on a hot day","I would recommend Guembe as a place to hang out by the beautiful pools on a hot day. The walks are OK, but not hugely special. Birds and butterfly’s are pretty amazing."
Aug 2019,50,Perfect spot to see wildlife and hangout in Santa Cruz,"We planned to spend 2 days in the Guembe resort but at the end we prolonged to three days and skipped the Samaipata. This was our end of 3 weeks travelling around Bolivia and we wanted to rest before flying home.    Why we loved the place:    1. interaction with animals. We were so close to parrots (all kinds, but we loved the huuge Aras), monkeys and butterflies like nowhere else.    2. butterflies. This all started with butterflies and they do great tours where they explain how the butterfly is born and how long they live.. and the species that have are amazing / butterfly bigger than my hand..    3. pools. There are so many places to rest near water.. two main pools and several smaller ones plus natural ponds where we rented a kayak.    4. many activities for everyone> animals, mini golf, beer garden, a spot for kids to play    5. morning/evening walks. we stayed overnight and had the park and animals for ourselves. They open at 9:30 and close around 6pm.    Ther service is nice, food okay, espresso small and strong enough :)."
Jun 2019,40,Amazing!,"Guembe is awesome! There is something for everyone. There are plenty of pools - big and little. There is an area with monkeys, birds, turtles and butterflies. There is a restaurant and other smaller huts to get food. There is a small gift shop. The bathrooms were clean. The staff was friendly. The only negative is that we were there on a Friday over a long holiday. The lines for the barbecue and buffet were ridiculously long. We asked the waitress for bottled waters and silverware and never got them. We even asked twice. We could have gotten up and left and not paid for the juices we ordered. She never came to check on us. Other than that, it is amazing"
May 2019,40,A nice day out,From our hotel the cost to get there was 80 bolivar.    The park itself is well looked after. The bird sanctuary was interesting as the birds do get pretty close to you. The Toucan where we sat was entertainment as it tried to nibble my shirt.    The pool area is nice also although we did not try swimming    Good place to take children as well
Apr 2019,40,A grat place to go with hot weather !,"Very nice place to go with friends or family, specially when the weather is hot to take advantage of all the water (swimmingpools,etc.)  Please take note that you are not permmited to take your ouwn food you have to buy in the place and the prices are a bit expensive for the quality of the food and service."
Jan 2019,50,Beautiful place,"If you want to see a lot of nature, birds, butterflies, flowers and swimming in differents swimming pools, this is your place"
Oct 2018,50,Fantastic getaway.,"We loved this place. The grounds are beautiful and well-kept. The swimming pool is amazing, plus there are kiddy pools as well. The buffet is delicious and has a huge variety. The best part for me was the bird enclosure, where the toucans perch right beside you and there are so many lovely birds to see (and don't miss the turtles). I would go here every time I was in Santa Cruz if I could. Well worth the money."
Sep 2018,30,Worst than security check at airports.,"Beautiful place to visit. Excellent food (buffet). The very negative point is that they check your bags and even handbags. Worst than security check at airports. Very negative experience for anybody, worst for visitors from other countries."
Sep 2018,30,"Fantastic place for a day trip, but not recommended for overnight stay","I booked to stay at Guembe for two nights as I was transiting and working and knew I wouldn't have time for city sightseeing. Lovely place, but two warnings to be aware of: I arrived on an early evening flight - and the first thing to note is that it is NOT 15 mins away, it's more like 45 mins in a taxi. It cost me 100BS on the way there and 120BS on the way back (which is quite expensive for Bolivia). Secondly, I was very upset to find that the gate staff wouldn't let me in at 8pm and told me to come back in the morning, despite having a confirmed reservation! They literally left me on a deserted and unlit track with no option of where to stay. So beware, they don't tell you that the reception closes at 6pm and you CAN'T check in after that.    Once I finally made it in the next day I had a great time visiting all the animals and walking around the gardens. The aviary is truly amazing and was my favourite place. It suited my needs as I was working a lot and it was a nice environment to work in, but otherwise I would say that a day trip would more than suffice. It was deserted at night, and a bit of a strange place to hang around in unless you're in a group. The advertised 19 pools is a bit of an oversell - they're essentially collections of very small pools split into two main areas. I visited in September and it was too cold to swim anyway, but imagine it would be lovely on a hot day. The food is excellent, but expensive by Bolivian standards - and there is nowhere else to go as it's far from anywhere - so be prepared to spend some money! I was a bit surprised to find breakfast wasn't included in the room price either.    The whole place looks a bit tired and run down, not quite as glam as the photos would have you think - but as long as you expect that then I think it's worth a visit, but wouldn't recommend staying over for more than a night. If you have young children it would be great fun - lots for them to do!"
Jul 2018,50,A far second place to samaipata but great,I was in Santa Cruz for a few days. Samaipata was by far my favorite sight but Guembe is def second place and great. If you have a family with you...I think this would a close second!    My tip would be to arrive upon opening to beat the crowd and heat. Rush thru one time to get good photos with the wildlife...then slow roll thru a second time as people start filling the park and bombarding the animals.    I think other reviews critiquing the price and sights are flat out inaccurate and written by people who don’t value immersion into the local wildlife! How can 20$ be too much for close ups with monkeys and parrots and tortoise and butterfly’s whole walking they as close to an Amazonian-like forested area as one while find WITHIN Santa Cruz proper????    I found the restaurant to be great as well. Upon request for a tapa and beer...the chef conjured me up the fancy dish pictured. This place was great in every sense.
Jun 2018,50,Simply wonderful,"This paradise is located only 20min away from the city. Be aware of the following: there are about 9 pools, and at least 5 of them are rocky. If you go with kids with a lot of energy keep an eye on them as every weekend there are at least one injured.  Otherwise, you will have fuuuun"
Jun 2018,40,Nice Rooms and Lovely Pools.,"We visited because our anniversary with my fiancé, rooms were very clean and pools were everywhere.  Lovely Place"
May 2018,40,Beautiful,You can spend a good few hours wondering round the different areas. From parrots and monkeys to fish and butterflies there is something for everyone. The pools are well kept and food is reasonably priced for a tourist destination. Well worth a visit if visiting Santa Cruz.
May 2018,40,"Very nice, but not so environment friendly as expected","I am currently visiting Guembe and think it is very nice and well worth coming here.  The concept is good and I think the animals have a quite good life here.  The restaurants are way overpriced - that was not a surprise - but when you eat at the kiosk, the biological and sustainable concept of Guembe breaks: you get plastic plates and plastic cutlery of the worst quality along with six small plastic bags of ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise.  (If you now say this could sometimes be more environment friendly than reusable cutlery for not having to have all the machinery to wash dishes, yes, but the restaurant serves with normal reusable cutlery and plates, so the all the utensils for washing would be there.)    All the rest is really nice but be prepared for music by the pool."
Apr 2018,40,Great Place to visit while in Santa Cruz!,"Biocentro Guembé is best known for its ""Mariposario"" (butterfly house), however, in my opinion, perhaps the most impressive place in the resort is The Aviary. It's huge and contains many tropical birds. There are several walks at different levels in the aviary allowing to see birds that enjoy the higher parts as well as those that feel more at home near the ground. Many of the birds are so used to human visitors that it is possible to see them at a very close range. The toucans and macaws even follow you so closely that one may get great close-up pictures of these friendly, colourful birds.  The resort has several lagoons, and pools and there are also many paths to enjoy the lush vegetation and, although it was no time for orchids during my visit I found the orchidarium structure very attractive."
Apr 2018,50,Very nice,"Something a bit different, birds and butterflies amazing. Lots of pools to choose from. Nice change from the city."
Jan 2018,50,Visited Several Times,"Amazing place.....when we arrive we never leave until check out. Great for gringos and locals, we will be returning. Recommend to anyone...pools are like ice water!!"
Jan 2018,50,"Beautiful experience, nice pools","It is without doubt one of the best attractions in Santa Cruz. You see many animals in their natural habitat: parrots, papagayos, toucans, peacocks,turtles, butterflies, monkeys. There are playgrounds for the little ones too, but what they liked the most are the pools. Food is also good."
Dec 2017,40,Paradise,"A beautiful, tranquil day out. The pools are wonderful, the butterflies beautiful and the kayaks a fun added extra. We spent a very relaxing day here. We found a 2 for 1 deal which made the entry price a lot more reasonable. The food sold inside is overpriced and underwhelming."
Oct 2017,50,Nice diversion from the city,"Spacious, clean and fun. Animals, birds, water, good food. Pools abound, exhibits are up and going. The bird enclosure was the best I have ever visited. All day for about $8.00 US (over 60 years old)."
Sep 2017,40,Nice day trip,"The area is lovely and all the facilities are top notch, personally not really my cup of tea but still worth a visit, my personal highlight was the tapir (and the fact that it wee'ed on my girlfriend)"
Sep 2017,50,Nature at your reach,"Totally recommended place to visit, you can relax in the pool and then go and see the amazing birds this place has, also the butterflies."
Aug 2017,40,Nice place to visit,"The botanical garden with its birds, turtles and butterflies is very nice to visit. The walking/hiking routes needs some maintenance and more visible signs. The pools and activities side is a different story. I would only recommend to visit the pools during the weekdays when there are less locals as the pools very quickly become a mix of sun tanning lotion/oil, hairs and spilled beer."
Aug 2017,40,Amazing place to get in contact with nature!!,"This place is amazing, it has a huge cage with birds, parrots and butterflies living on it, the food is good and the swimming pools are huge, clean and beautiful, great waterfalls where you can get nice pictures.  If you want to relax and get in touch with bolivian nature this place is the best one! loved it."
Jul 2017,50,The best place to visit,"A lovely place with birds, turtles, swimming pools and places specially designed to walk and relax with nature. Excellent infrastructure, good service and acceptable food. Very easy access by taxi from the city."
May 2017,40,Lovely local eco-park,"Can see all of in it under 2 hours, or spend the day at the many pools & fun activities like mini-golf. This place is probably packed on nice weekend. My favorite was the Bird enclosure, which is full of friendly, photographic parrots. May is wrong time for most butterflies (January is best) but the butterfly enclosure & hatchery are both interesting. Pricey at 140 Bolivianos (about $20 US) for admission."
May 2017,50,Biocentro Guembe Mariposario,"What a gem of a place not too far from the city of Santa Cruz de La Sierra. Such a relaxing place with nice walks through the clean landscaped grounds. A lovely butterfly and bird exhibit and little Capuchin monkeys jumping through the trees overhead. We stayed long enough to have buffet lunch at the restaurant, the food was good with a lot of choices. For 180 Bolivianos each it was well worth the price of admission with lunch included. A must see especially if you have young children."
May 2017,50,Perfect place to spend the day,"This was our favorite place in Santa Cruz! The grounds are beautiful and the few animals they have here seem to have enough space to roam. The bird aviary was our favorite. Parrots, Toucans, and a host of other birds within reach, literally, the parrots were chewing on my back pack and a Toucan tried to eat my son's shoe.  The butterflies were lovely, but depending on the time of year you may have less variety. The pools were clean and very refreshing, perfect end to the day. We would definitely return."
Apr 2017,50,It was a grey rainy day and still an excellent experience!,"I enjoyed this place so much! You can walk among butterflies and all sorts of tropical birds! Animal habitats are very well mantained and large enough for all the animals in it. I had a great experience with spider monkeys that were hugging and playing with me! We also spotted several wild tucanillos, capuchin monkeys and a squirrel roaming free around the area.    The meal in the restaurant was well worth of the money, i recommend eating there if you're up for a delicious culinary spa ;)    BUT BEWARE!!  Hide your sunglasess when entering aviario, my friends were stolen by the sneaky large parrot!! We laughed it off though :)"
Mar 2017,50,Beautiful day trip out of Santa Cruz,Go to the aviary. See the toucans and butterfly garden. The pool is great and the buffer food is good.
Mar 2017,50,Lugar exquisito... Lovely place for visiting anytime.,Your mind will be fully with peace and stunned beauty. The staff is friendly the owner is an very kind person. The nature at this place looks like a dream. You will be able to see endemic species and discover a lot of information with a guide for everyone.  Landscapes like no other bring your camera.  Hours of joy is a fact my friend.
Mar 2017,50,Great place to relax and be in touch with nature,"At Guembe, you can swim at the pools, walk around a beautiful garden and see thousands of butterflies and orchids. There are ponds where you can kayak and have a nice lunch in the restaurant."
Feb 2017,40,An interesting animal sanctuary and reserve,"We visited this reserve/park and were very impressed with the range of facilities for the native wildlife. There is a very large butterfly enclosure, an enormous aviary and an enclosure for monkeys under construction.    As well, there are swimming pools for all ages so it is easy to see why the park is such an attraction for the locals on weekends."
Feb 2017,40,Good way to spend a day,"We (four adults) had been to Santa Cruz multiple times and had one day to kill in the area. We heard Guembé was great. We started by exploring the monkey, butterfly, spider, bird, and other animal enclosures. The spider monkeys are super cool. The butterflies are lovely. You can get right up close to huge colorful parrots (watch out, some will try to grab you!). It was a HOT day, so then we were ready for the pools. There were loads of people, but we managed to find 4 chairs in a shady area that wasn't too crowded. One of the pool areas is big and open with loud pumping dance music. That was not for us. The other area has clusters of smaller pools. The music is lower key and can be escaped if you aren't right by the bar. The water was refreshing. The food... not so much. Burgers and fries that tasted like they'd been fried in the burger oil. They make it hard to pay by credit card. You can at some spots but not others. There are three bars, and a few places to eat. The main restaurant would be the best food (a buffet that looked decent), but they were closing by the time we were ready for lunch. The bar that serves margaritas didn't take visas, so they missed out on a good sale! Later we played mini golf, which was fun, until they closed. Entry cost, around $20 per adult, only around $9 USD for seniors."
Feb 2017,30,What happened?,Been here every year in January and am not happy about the downhill changes.  The prices have actually doubled. Service is not what was once expected. I see they are building a monkey attraction to which I'm not too happy about. I have been recommended to other attractions that I will definitely substitute this for.
Jan 2017,20,Food,"The food is expensive! At least if you get a hamburger think twice, the patty comes from the supermarket and it's a totally bad quality burger for 5 dollars. I suggest you get a really good breakfast before you go in and grab your own water!"
Jan 2017,50,Butterfly sanctuary,"Beautiful scientific oriented butterfly protection safeguard and beautiful pools and grounds to visit nature as well as great food, lagoon."
Jan 2017,50,Family oriented upscale pool resort,"Fun in the pool for every age level! Many many sandy bottom pools with water slides, multi-colored night lighting, shady spots. Great place to cool off in the hot Bolivian heat. The museums, aviary, butterfly houses were fascinating for grandchildren and adults. Overnight accommodations were very comfortable. All activities on the property within walking distance of your room. Please remember to bring your passport, required for checking in."
Jan 2017,50,Very nice,Great place to spend a day but it also has now a hotel to stay for more than a day. Special for nature lovers just make sure to bring enough repellent and sunblock
Jan 2017,50,Great Day Trip!,"This is a great place to spend a day while in Santa Cruz. The park is beautiful and the pools are very nice. Take bug spray, though...the mosquitos were out of control."
Dec 2016,50,Beauty & nature!,"A wonderful, peaceful & educational day in nature. Wandering through the butterfly house, interesting talks & some of the most peaceful moments strolling around the gardens. Bird enclosure was delightful & the birds are often close enough for some terrific photos. A lovely couple of eateries on site too for lunch."
Nov 2016,50,Lots to see & do,"Here you can observe birds, butterflies, monkeys, orchide and walk in the ""jungle"". There are several pools where you can swim and relax. Must see if you visit Santa Cruz. The buffet was good, but expensive."
Nov 2016,50,Perfect to relax,"Its a little far from the city, but it's a really nice option for spend a day, It has 15 natural swiming pool, you can montain horse, make kayaking, a bigger reserve of butterfly, definitely recomended it."
Nov 2016,40,Calm day away from the city,"Was a day well spent in the sun. Cool experiences and friendly people! Recommended to families with younger children, also groups of friends"
Nov 2016,50,Great place to see local fauna,"It's a nice but a bit expensive option If you have nothing to do in Santa Cruz and want to see the diversity of local birds, reptiles and butterflies. The fastest way to get there is by taxi (approx 20-30 min drive)"
