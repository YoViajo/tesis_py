review Yesterday,50,"Fantastic food & drinks at outdoor movie night, Pix on the Plaza","My friends and I watched 10 Things I Hate About You while eating delicious dishes (the salmon, the gnocchi, and the burger were all 10/10 excellent) and drinking fun cocktails, outdoors on the Standard's plaza. Also great service. My friends said it was the highlight of their month to have a night out and do something fun but still stay COVID safe outdoors, and I agreed. We will definitely be coming back for more Pix on the Plaza movie screening nights."
May 3,50,Artsy. Modern. Wonderful.,Artsy. Modern. Clean. Such a wonderful front desk crew. Great location of town in terms of getting around. Tons of neighboring restaurants and coffee shops. The Chelsea market is only a block away and is filled with great places to eat as well as cool shops. The highline is a block away and it’s such a great walk in view of the river. The Whitney Museum is two blocks away. Seriously had such a great time. Highly recommend.
May 3,50,Birthday weekend,"Absolutely loved staying here. Corner king room was very clean and comfortable. The bedside speaker came in handy late night/ early morning when I could hear someone from below enjoying themselves. The bath is so relaxing. Awesome views, great food, and friendly staff. I can't wait to go back!"
May 3,50,Review for the restaurant only. Pleasant surprise in very busy neighborhood.,"Reception a little cold , due probably to many diners arriving at once all with reservations, but once seated, excelllent oysters, good service (Mark) and an unusual and tasty mussels preparation. A warm place in the middle of crazy and loud Meatpacking neighborhood. Nice decor too. Keep it personal. I recommend this place. Reservations strongly recommended.  You should give a spoon with the mussels. So much sauce. And so good..."
May 1,50,"Great business trip, with a touch of pleasure.","What great trip to NYC and as always the PHENOMINAL Standard high line!! Mandee took great care of us at check in, and check out. Have to say, all of the staff are so friendly and accommodating. If you’re going to be in NYC, go straight to the meatpacking dos truck and art at the standard."
Apr 2021,50,Make sure to check out the Standard Grill!,"We had a great evening celebrating our anniversary as part of their ""Pix on the Plaza"" outdoor movie + dinner :) Great burgers, and amazing warm cookies! Great service by the entire staff at the Standard Grill"
Apr 2021,50,"Great views, room and staff!","Amazing view of the Freedom Tower, Greenwich Village, the Whitney Museum, the Hudson River and Hoboken!  Room was small, mostly the bed, but has a nice seating area and ,really, who cares with that magnificent view! Soaking tub was a treat! Amazing water pressure. Even the included toiletries were really nice!  Entire wall was a Floor to ceiling window (yes, there are room darkening AND sheer curtains!)  Our room (1518) was right off the elevator area but it was extremely quiet!  Great location, it is at the border of Chelsea and West Greenwich Village. The southern entrance to the High Line is at the opposite end of the block! An Icon Parking Garage was a few blocks away and cost 35$ per 24 hour period if staying at the Standard. Really easy loading in front of the hotel. Not on a busy street.  Yes, the design is modern and hip but we felt at home. The staff was friendly and helpful. Made us very comfortable  We went to The Standard Grill for breakfast twice and drinks/apps, it was very good! Next time we will try Hector’s Cafe next to the entrance to the High Line. They had great coffee!"
Apr 2021,40,Comfy room w/ nice views,"Stayed in the Hudson Studio. View was amazing. Bed and seating area was nice. I really liked the paved bike lanes nearby and the Citi Bike rental right behind the hotel. Front desk staff were friendly and room service came quick. Bath tub was great although I was too short (5'0"") for it and kept going under when I leaned back. I did think it was weird that inside the restaurant I had to buy food in order to buy alcohol, but that wasnt the case for room service. Overall I would stay again."
Apr 2021,40,Cool kids only,"Small but very quiet room. Comfortable but no shower door let a lot of water out, hard to keep it dry in front of sink . Overall design and decor is trendy and modern. Loved the elevator display screens. Interesting views of the Highline. Watch out if you don't close the curtains! Floor to ceiling glass directly facing office buildings. Fortunately they were mostly empty. Nice redeveloped neighborhood with lots of new fancy shops."
Apr 2021,40,Amal is the best!,"Staff at this hotel is exceptional, Amal is truly fabulous and so kind!    One thing I will say is there really is no “blanket” in the room. So request 2 blankets if you’re a cold sleeper. Other than that, everything was special."
Apr 2021,10,Beware of miscellaneous charges.,"While the staff at the hotel were terrific and accommodating, the hotel room was tiny, but comfortable, I was charged with dubious room service charges and the hotel ghosted me on a resolution.    I traveled to NYC for work and when I returned home after my stay I saw I was charged $70 in room service. When I tried to address the erroneous charges I received an email with even more charges. I wrote several frustrated emails and they just ignored them. I am out about $120 dollars in room service charges, orders made when I was working and not at the hotel. I even cc'd my bosses on the correspondence who corraborated that I was indeed not at the hotel when those charges were made.    Infuriating. So check your cc statements after being there, it could be some form of scam operating internally."
Apr 2021,50,"Great location, great views, great service","As a New Yorker, only on a few occasions have I stayed at hotels in NYC. I've been a regular at The Standard Miami and decided to stay a little staycation in my city. I stayed at The Standard High Line which was amazing: great location, great views and great service."
Apr 2021,50,Pix on the Plaza with Andy!,"Gathered with a gaggle of pals for The Standard, High Line’s weekly outdoor movie night, Pix on the Plaza! The venue is terrific - all the tables outside are spread out with their own Bluetooth speakers and great views of the screen, and there’s free popcorn and the full Standard Grill menu. We went for the 4/20 special screening of Dazed & Confused. Andy was our server and he’s the best! He was so friendly and charming and made some great wine recommendations and told us about the special holiday menu. We ordered disco fries and chicken wings to share, and I had the vegetarian spiced chickpea burger as my entree and the Ginger Baby cocktail. Yum, yum, yum! All was delish. It was such a blast and can’t wait to come back for another flick."
Apr 2021,50,Standard Grille,"Ben welcomed us to the Grille. Atmosphere was exquisite, we were well separated from other guests and felt safe. The food was delicious and Ben made sure we had an excellent time. I highly recommend. It was great!"
Apr 2021,50,Anniversary Staycation!,We booked the Corner King with the Bubbles package and loved it! Stunning views and the bathtub was amazing. The staff was so nice and helpful. We asked if they had anything for us to have a bubble bath and they were able to provide that. We came to celebrate our 2nd anniversary and we couldn't have had a more perfect time. Gorgeous hotel. We booked a table at Le Bain one night and enjoyed every second of it. The Standard Grill had delicious food. Everyone was so kind; I cannot stress that enough. I recommend this hotel to everyone I know!
Apr 2021,50,Great stay!,"Location is perfect. Room was simple and clean. We had dinner at the Standard Grill both nights, food + service was fantastic. We loved Ally our server. Returning again this upcoming weekend to meet with clients."
Apr 2021,50,Home Away From Home,"I have been a regular guest of this hotel for many years. The hotel is like a home away from home. Very trendy place in a great location that attracts a trendy crowd. The staff is extremely helpful, especially given the current Covid-19 crisis. The staff, including Ha Tran at the front desk is very professional and helpful. My regular Deluxe King room is always beautifully appointed, very quiet with spectacular views. I'm actually going back in a few days and can't wait. Thank you, The Standard, for a delightful visit each time."
Apr 2021,50,Birthday,Amazing! Ally was the best! So accommodating and a pleasure to talk to! She Was very knowledgeable of the drink menu and suggested a loving pairing with my dish ordered! Not to mention her beautiful curls!
Apr 2021,50,Great Night,"My girlfriend and I had the pleasure of staying at the standard high line on a weekday. It was a “staycation.” We had beautiful views of the city skyline and the staff was attentive, friendly and helpful!"
Apr 2021,50,Staycation getaway,"I was elated to stay at this hotel for my spring break from work. I later learned that my excitement was not in vein.    I stayed in the Corner King with a river view for two nights. The room was well-kept and stylish. The room comes with a mini bar, safe, tv, fridge, and Bluetooth speaker. The bed was very comfortable although I am accustomed to higher bed frames. The view was spectacular. You truly feel like royalty wall to wall windows. They also had a seating area for guests which I found strategical. The shower and toilet are separately placed (smart move). Although I prefer a removable shower head, the shower waterfall was extremely relaxing.    The elevator comes with music and visual entertainment to entertain the hotel Visitors. The robes and slippers were divine. The staff members from the kitchen, front desk, room service, and housekeeping were nothing short of hospitable and accommodating. Edgar was extremely helpful from booking the reservation to checkout. I do not recall the other team members by name but there are definitely some gems! Please bear in mind that the hotel is often very busy so there will be times you are required wait on hold for the front desk to assist.    You are in the heart of great restaurants (TAO, STK Rooftop, Catch Steak, Catch Seafood, 1 Oak, etc) and higher class stores like all saints and Tesla. I will certainly be returning!    Tip: use spot hero for parking. I paid $50 for two night overnight parking at the local garage located at 161 10th avenue. Very convenient walking distance. But I love to walk so it’s completely up to your personal preference."
Apr 2021,10,This is NOT a luxury hotel!!!!,"For a special occasion I booked a ""Superior King"" room that advertised a spectacular view, and got a view directly out at pipes and mechanicals on neighboring rooftops. When I expressed dissatisfaction I was told ""we consider anything above the 11th floor to be superior."" When I explained why this was not a satisfaction for not having the advertised view, I was repeatedly told ""but it was above 11."" Room was not right next to elevators -- there was one guest room in between -- but we STILL heard the elevator hydraulics all night long (sounds like a slide whistle). This information garnered shrugged shoulders from the front desk. This was particularly baffling now since, given that the pandemic is not over, there seemed to be hardly ANY guests in the hotel at all so why give someone a terrible room when others were clearly available? When checking in I asked for a late checkout as advertised prominently on their website to be a perk, and was told ""you booked on hotels.com so that doesn't apply to you."" Room was as small as a pod hotel room (teeny-tiny and basic). Don't misunderstand -- I actually love pod hotels -- I just don't love when I pay luxury hotel prices and get a pod-sized room. And pod hotels, in my experience, don't come with ultra-rude staff, misleading promises, and elevator sounds all night long. In addition, the $200 hold on my credit card for amenities was left on my card (and a myriad of inexplicable charges aside from usual city/state tax, including Jacob Javitts tax, occupancy fee, and facilities fee). I am now told the amenities fee may not be refunded for ""between one or two weeks,"" ostensibly not because The Standard is holding it but because my credit card company is holding it. (Not something Capital One has EVER done before and I don't believe they're doing it now.) HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE STEER CLEAR!!!!!"
Apr 2021,50,Always a great time,"I recently stayed at the Standard High Line to belatedly celebrate a birthday. It's hard to express how pleased I was with our stay. The room was spectacular, the service and staff were top notch (as always) (thank you, Amahl!), and the facilities were hip and sleek as ever. I love the Standard's hotels, and the High Line is certainly a gem in their collection."
Apr 2021,50,Perfect evening with a view,"My friend treated me to a one-night stay for my birthday. My girlfriend and I were surprised to have received a complimentary upgrade to a Hudson Studio with the Hudson River view and the clawfoot tub. Our room was absolutely perfect, with a view of the Empire State Building from the tub. We enjoyed the Plaza for dinner, service and food were excellent.    I want to say thank you to Ha Tran, who worked the Friday shift at the front desk. Just such a gracious & helpful person. Would highly recommend & will be back!"
Apr 2021,30,Stay at the Standard,"Clean, quiet room with beautiful view as advertised and really enjoyed having dinner outdoors with Pix on the Plaza — A highlight. I also loved how large the tub was in the King Deluxe room. The gym was also very clean and nice. And you could reserve time so you were never in the gym with more than 1-2 other people.    However, my main issues were:    + the windows were covered in rain/water stains so the view was tainted by really dirty windows    + the TV/ Internet connection was horrible. You cannot play Netflix, Hulu or really any major streamer from your phone without experiencing glitches or having the TV disconnect because of an “error with the connection.” We moved from the first room because of this issue and it we experienced this problem in both rooms. The maintenance person basically told us certain streaming services just don’t work on the Apple TV— but that wasn’t explained to us before booking.    + also it is a $200/per booked night hold on your account for incidentals. So be aware of this. So 2 nights = an additional $400 being held on your card not including the original cost of the stay.    + the first time housekeeping changed our linens, they didn’t give us a top sheet!! So it was just the bottom sheet and the comforter which made for a cold/uncomfortable sleep. Bed also isn’t super comforter or padded."
Apr 2021,50,Light at the end of tunnel!,After being furloughed and quarantined for months to celebrate my new job and we decided to venture to the Standard Highline - 0 regrets. The whole experience reminded me of the good times in NYC before 2020 hit us. Check-in was quick and efficient with a lovely Miss Brynn (I believe). The room was amazing views of the water and a beautiful tub to relax in the staff also sent up a lovely amenity. The food & beverage venues seem to have begun to open up and it was great to see the city alive again. It was a great trip and I would come back in a heartbeat.
Apr 2021,10,"Fire alarm kept going off, could not sleep","Throughout the night, the fire alarm went off, along with loud announcements that it was only a ""test"". Needed sleep for a job interview but needless to say couldn't get any. Will not be staying here again next time we come into the city."
Apr 2021,50,Bingo was worth the babysitter,"Bingo on Easter was a blast, thanks in large part to Greg! Awesome server, totally made the night. Babysitters are expensive so it’s gotta be worth it when you spring for a night out.    COVID protocols are on point too, felt totally safe."
Apr 2021,50,Standard Bingo,"I’m literally just leaving this review to praise Greg our server. An absolute legend. We had such an amazing time at Bingo. Can’t wait to go back. The food and drinks were also incredible. Had such an amazing time, can’t wait to go back."
Apr 2021,50,Greg = the G.O.A.T.,"Sometimes service can make or break a night. Greg is one of those people who can set a vibe...an elite vibe. He was warm, funny, attentive and responsible for creating the environment for one of the best nights of my life."
Apr 2021,50,"Perfect for lunch & dinner with family, fantastic service, each dish and beverage expertly crafted","Beautiful ambiance. Presentation of the dishes was as beautiful as they were delicious. The Hanger steak was simply perfect.  The drinks are made by a true mixologist, balanced complex flavors that compliments your meal. The Everlasting was a pleasant, light, citrusy aromatic dark rum drink that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Ashlynn was our server for dinner. She was friendly, engaging, professional and attentive. She made our visit positively wonderful.  Overall I highly recommend the Standard Grill for the service, for the food and for the cocktails. Great overall experience."
Apr 2021,50,I <3 greg,"The food was great as was the beer. The real draw to this place , though,, was the service, particularly the server,Greg. What a great guy. The place was packed and he went above and beyond to make sure our table had everything we needed. Five stars for Greg"
Apr 2021,50,Amazing stay at The Standard!,"We have stayed at The Standard a few times over the last year for a staycation and have had a wonderful experience each time! Christian Parker was so helpful in getting us set up with our reservations for each of our stays. He also went above and beyond by touching base with us before our stay, during our stay, and after our stay to make sure that we had everything we needed and that our stay was up to our expectations (it was!).    In addition to Christian, the rest of the staff was also amazing! We truly appreciate how friendly, helpful, and efficient everyone was - it honestly felt like a vacation at a 5 star resort without even having to leave NYC!    If you want to feel like a VIP, I highly recommend staying at The Standard Highline. The location, the staff, the room service, everything makes it an unforgettable experience. We will for sure be back!"
Apr 2021,50,Great Staycation,"Had a great weekend staycation here in order to stave off the pandemic boredom. We were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and my partner's birthday. We were surprised to have received a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe queen with the Hudson River view which kicked off our staycation so nicely. Everyone wore masks unless they were eating or drinking at the bars and restaurants. We ate room service for dinner both nights and it was delicious and arrived to the room promptly. Le Bain was a really cool bar. Unfortunately, we couldn't sit outside for the weather but the drinks were delicious. The hotel is also located right above the southern most entrance to the High Line which was perfect. My only complaint with Le Bain was that it felt a little crowded, but our host was very gracious and accommodating when we asked to sit further away from the other individuals in the bar. One of the highlights of the stay was Miss Bren who worked the Friday night shift at the front desk. Just such an incredible and funny person. Loved them! Definitely would return to have a splurgy staycation again."
Apr 2021,50,Jenny,Jenny was amazing at the biergarten!! She was sweet and very helpful! She let us move tables and was so accommodating to all of us! she was super fun and nice and would definitely come back to have her as my server!
Apr 2021,50,Jenny,Best waitress ever! She let us move multiple times because we were super cold - super attentive and great! Was super patient and made sure we were accommodated at all times and really made the whole experience worth it!
Apr 2021,50,a+ review,"Jenny was the greatest waitress I’ve ever had. She was so accommodating, receptive and friendly. She helped us move tables when we were cold and brought us food and drinks so quickly. Cant wait to see her again!"
Apr 2021,50,Benjamin is not standard!,I dined at the standard grill and from the start it seemed like we were in for a long night. Our server barely greeted us and acknowledged us after we had been sitting for 10 minutes. Benjamin came by our table to check in with us and after voicing our frustration he immediately took control and made sure that we had a valuable experience. It ended up being a great night which actually led us to stay at the hotel based off of Benjamin’s recommendation of the hotel. We can’t thank Benjamin enough and hope to see him again when we return!
Mar 2021,50,An Amazing Experience,"My stay was amazing. The hotel was easy to find, it looked amazing, and the staff were all so incredibly kind. We ordered food service and it came even faster than we expected and was more delicious than we could’ve imagined. The room was stunning and had an incredible view to match. The complimentary wine with our bath was the icing on top. We’re definitely planning on coming back soon. It was the greatest experience we’ve ever had."
Mar 2021,50,I'm GAGA for Standard Movie Night!!,"My friends and I met up at the plaza to see A Star is Born, one of the movie nights the Standard hosts weekly. It was so nice to sit outside in a safe & warm environment with great service & food. Navit and the team took great care of us during the movie and even offered us complimentary popcorn. Absolutely can't wait to come back for another move night -- it's so much better than watching a movie at home! Thank you for an unforgettable evening."
Mar 2021,10,HORRIBLE STAY AT THE STANDARD DO NOT BOOK,"Please stay anywhere else but here! Poor staff, rude, disgusting, and careless. I cant even put into words how HORRIBLE my experience was here. I stayed here on my birthday. from the moment I checked in I was met with rude and dismissive staff members. I was given a room and once entering it kicked out of the room by the hotel cleaning staff RUDELY. when I went back to the lobby to change rooms no apologies no accommodation. It was my birthday not once was it mentioned by the staff or acknowledged. I spent most of the day out and got back around 8pm with my three friends and we were laughing and enjoying card games. I was Rudely told once to quiet down and “dont make me come back here” by a man on the floor. He then returned with the “manager” who told us we needed to vacate the room. We were ultimately thrown out along with my friends ON MY BIRTHDAY. We were not loud but even if that was the case the standards social media has tons of people celebrating their birthdays there. It was the reason I chose to have a get together with my friends there. I was not told prior about any noise rules or protocol and in a vacant hotel ON MY BIRTHDAY. Why not move me to a vacant room. I was treated so poorly from the moment I entered the premises to the moment I was kicked out. I pleaded with them to let my friend who was intoxicated stay I told them she could not drive home drunk. they told me they did not care how she got home she had to leave. It was insanely disgusting behavior from the staff."
Mar 2021,50,Above Standard! :),"Amazing location, amazing staff, AMAZING all around! I really enjoyed every second in and around the hotel! So much to offer. Everything is super close by. It was my wife's first time in NY - now the Standard is The Standard! We will definitely be back soon!"
Mar 2021,50,Beautiful time,"Beautiful hotel stay despite the Covid 19 situation, the room really nice the view was incredible in every way , spectacular.... bathroom well put together, carpet area near window needed alittle repair but still really nice room ... room service a plus , asked for an extra item of fresh strawberries upon arrival and was waiting in room “ perfect “ , robes in room really nice quality , the front desk reception was exceptional and so so friendly , the grill was a really nice restaurant a must go to ... covid made some little things trying but in all was a great time"
Mar 2021,50,Amazing BINGO,This is absolutely not your standard bingo. For instance: Can you win a bottle of champagne? Yes! Do you have to have a dance off to win a bingo tie? Yes! Should you order the punch bowl for six for your party of 3? YES!
Mar 2021,50,Bingo night,"Drinks, dancing, bingo, friends, laughs - all of it. A really fun night in NYC. Delicious food, amazing servers, hilarious host, a really good time. Definitely get the punch bowl, it’s good value foe a good time!"
Mar 2021,50,Woo,"Bingo was fire. If you’re thinking about it just do it!! Please come here and drink your face off. It is a blast. The servers are hot and awesome: the food is great, music dope, drugs hit, just freaking goooo!"
Mar 2021,50,B-I-N-G-O is back,"We came here for couples night to celebrate getting the vaccines and a (hopefully!) return to normal. Nothing says normal to me like a drunk bingo!    The whole staff took care of us from entrance to check. The MC kept the night lively and moving. (Want to shout out my fellow recovering emo kids with balls karaoke and I’m just a Kid)    Jenny made sure we kept well fed (oysters, Korean Fried Chicken, Fish Tacos) and drinks full (two punch bowls).    Just go for the bigger. You know you’ll drink it!"
Mar 2021,50,Raja anniversary honeymoon.,Pretty incredible. Pandemic no more. It was a spectacular evening. We had a such a blast and we loved it. Th AJ you for a wonderful time. It was bingo night and I was with my favorite friends. Food was great. Drinks were Amazixng.
Mar 2021,50,B-I-N-G-O,Bingo is a vibeeeeee! Def start with a punch bowl - you’ll ask for the small to seem modest but wish you got the large at first. Went through two bowls and I feel LIT! Bingo is def a good time the MC is a great host! Jenny the serve was so sweet and lovely - made sure we had everything we needed and kept the drinks flowing! Only warning the Korean fried chicken is hella spicy! 100/100! Def come it’s worth it!
Mar 2021,50,The standard Bingo,"Such a fun night of Bingo at the standard! The service was amazing, drinks were flowing and food was abundant. It made me so happy to be out and having fun. Highly recommend this fun event for anyone looking for a fun time."
Mar 2021,30,Extra Charges,"All I used was the hand soap. I didn’t order room service. I kept everything clean, etc... Yet my friend who was in another room did not have to show her ID or give her CC info over in order to get her room. We both paid in advance online. Yet I was charged extra and she was not. I feel so bitter that I don’t want to return. There are plenty of other hotels to choose from. I will say, I liked the bed sheets."
